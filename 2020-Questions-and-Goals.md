# Questions and Goals for 2020 Election Coverage

## Questions

### Pre election

What offices are up for election?

What do those offices do and what is their jurisdiction?

Who's running?

Who's contributing to their campaigns?

How much money do they have?

How did each party do in the past few elections?

Has there been a trend of changing support? -- also, where should I look for those numbers?

Ad expenditures?

## During Election

How is everyone doing?

### Post Election

Who won?

Did anything change since the last election? Was there a shift in the balance of power?

What can we learn from the changing patterns?

Was the turnout in this election different from past elections?

## Goals

We need a live map for the primaries -- especially for the state and local races. We should also make sure that we have solid graphics for whatever's going on in federal races.

## ToDo

1. Install anaconda, holoviz, so you can use Dask to read larger datasets and work with stuff over 20 years

2. Read along on [this post](http://aarongonzales.net/posts/nerd/2017/05/15/bpd_cm_advanced/)

3. See if you can put together a ZIP code to lat/long dataset

4. learn how to do mapping in geoviews

5. Create a map of all the political contributions in Texas over the last 20 years.
    - Where are donations coming from?
    
6. Then, with the full dataset, see who the largest contributors over the last 20 years have been
    - then group that into 10-year, 5-year, and 1-year periods
    - has there been a pattern?
    - if so, has it stayed the same?
7. Group the same data by contributions to politicians in San Angelo.
